To execute, make sure the following folder 
conditions are met: 
(1) data contains folders whose names are the image labels
which those folders contain the SIFT descriptors of each
image. These are used for training the model.
(2) dictionary contains the codebook; to specify the name
of the codebook, go into LLC_Test.py and in line 26, 
change the value of codebookName to a string that is the
name of your desired codebook
(3) features will later contain folders whose names are 
image labels and whose folders will later contain the
final image representations of each image from "data".
Will overwrite whatever is currently inside
(4) test contains folder whose names are the image labels
which those folders contain the SIFT descriptors of each
image. These are used for testing the model. Make sure
these images are different from the ones in "data".

to execute, run 

	python LLC_Test.py

at the command line.
